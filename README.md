# Hi there 👋

I'm OriginCode, you might have seen XtenDimension, Force0x1, COMPL.EXE, 千須末, 泉湧花 or CONN.EXE somewhere, they are all me.

Most of my personal projects are hosted and maintained on my GitLab instance [Factoria](https://factoria.origincode.me/OriginCode).

I'm currently a [UW Seattle](https://www.washington.edu) undergraduate student, B.S. in [Informatics](https://ischool.uw.edu).

I'm an amateur software engineer, I'm also interested in Chinese linguistics (I'm a Northern Wu Chinese speaker!).

I use [AOSC OS](https://aosc.io) as my daily driver, it's also the Linux distribution that I make contributions to. For my servers, I prefer [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org).

## MUG?

I'm also a rhythm game player, I spend most of my free time playing beatmania IIDX (as of 2024-09-04 I'm SP 中伝 and DP 五段) and Be-Music Source (BMS) (as of 2024-09-04 I'm ★3 sl5).

I also play a wide range of other arcade rhythm games, PC rhythm games too, but no mobile ones (I don't like tapping on a flat surface, so I don't play CHUNITHM either).
