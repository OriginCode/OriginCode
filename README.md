# Hi there 👋

I'm OriginCode, you might have seen XtenDimension, Force0x1, COMPL.EXE, 千須末, 泉湧花 or CONN.EXE somewhere, they are all me!

I'm currently a [University of Washington - Seattle](https://www.washington.edu) undergraduate student, B.S. in [Informatics](https://ischool.uw.edu/).

I'm an amateur software engineer, I'm also interested in Chinese linguistics (I'm a Northern Wu Chinese speaker!).

I use [AOSC OS](https://aosc.io) as my daily driver, it's also the Linux distribution that I make contributions to.

## MUG?

I'm also a rhythm game player, I spend most of my free time playing beatmania IIDX. I also play a wide range of other arcade rhythm games, PC rhythm games too, but no mobile ones (I don't like tapping on a screen).
